# CoDriver Android Application
## Overview
CoDriver is a proactive solution designed to improve driving safety and transparency. Unlike traditional auto insurance models that primarily consider demographics (such as age, gender, and location), CoDriver focuses on actual driving proficiency to help prevent accidents before they occur.

By leveraging a microcontroller device equipped with spatial sensors (accelerometer, GPS, etc.) and a smartphone app, CoDriver monitors driving habits, provides real-time feedback on potentially dangerous behavior, and collects crucial data for accident reconstruction in case an incident occurs.

## Key Features
* **Real-Time Driver Feedback:** The app identifies potentially dangerous driving patterns using advanced pattern recognition and notifies the driver, allowing for immediate improvement.
* **Accident Reconstruction:** In the event of an accident, CoDriver gathers detailed mechanical data (e.g., speed, acceleration, GPS location) to assist in determining the cause of the incident.
* **Driver Input Monitoring:** Tracks steering, braking, and acceleration patterns to detect dangerous habits.
* **Transparent Data Flow:** Provides clear, actionable insights to help drivers enhance their skills before accidents or traffic stops occur.
